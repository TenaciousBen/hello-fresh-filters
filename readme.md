# Wtf is this

This is a really simple 'applet' to add filtering functionality to the frontend of hellofresh.co.uk. If you've used hellofresh.co.uk, then you've probably noticed that they've got lots of recipes each week, but finding the precise ones you want is a bit of a chore, requiring you to read through everything on offer. This tries to solve that by allowing you to filter recipes based on their tags, their name and their cooking time.

# How does it work

1. Copy the contents of /dist/bundle.txt
2. Make a bookmark in Chrome with the Name 'Hello Fresh Filters' and set the 'Url' to the copied string above - it's easiest to do this by right-clicking the Chrome Bookmarks bar and clicking `Add page...`
3. Go on to your Hello Fresh meal selection view and click the above bookmark
4. Use the filters that appear just below your selections for the week
